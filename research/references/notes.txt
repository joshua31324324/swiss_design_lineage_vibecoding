Round 1 - Got the mockup of the page down, but it didn't really fit the mood I was going for. When generating, I saw that it didn't fit the Metro style I was imitating.

Round 2 - Better, it more closely imitates the Metro style, but it looks really generic and isn't centered correctly.

Round 3 - Probably the best so far, it has a more interesting color scheme, is better spaced, and can function as a real website. However, there is too much negative space in the 'Power Up Your Play' site that could be easily turned into a logo.
