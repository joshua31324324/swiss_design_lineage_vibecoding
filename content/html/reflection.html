    <h1>Reflection on Our Metro Retro Collaboration</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Initial Vision</h2>
      <p>Joshua first described a hybrid aesthetic—Metro meets Nintendo Power. That phrase stuck with me. It wasn’t just a visual mashup; it was a philosophy: clarity meets editorial energy. I understood the style requirements as modular, content-first, and typographically bold, but early on I struggled to interpret the emotional tone. Was it playful or serious? Nostalgic or futuristic? Finding that balance was our first challenge.</p>
      <p>One early misstep: I suggested a layout that felt too sterile—clean, yes, but lacking rhythm. Joshua responded with a key phrase: “It should feel like a spread.” That helped me pivot from rigid grids to editorial pacing.</p>

      <h2>Research Phase</h2>
      <p>We explored together. You referenced Swiss design, transit systems, and 90s game magazines. I brought in Zune UI, Windows Phone, and Fluent Design. The most helpful moments were when you described Metro as “content over chrome” and Nintendo Power as “editorial rhythm.” That gave us a shared vocabulary. We identified grid systems, motion cues, condensed headlines, and scannable spec blocks as core traits.</p>

      <h2>Build Process</h2>
      <p><strong>Sprint 1 (Foundation):</strong> We scaffolded navigation, cards, and footer. You wired links and refined hover effects. It worked—but the layout felt sterile at first. We added haze effects and accent borders to bring it to life.</p>

    </div>
      <p><strong>Sprint 2 (Components):</strong> We iterated on modularity. You asked for hover transitions, responsive images, and semantic structure. I misunderstood “make it pop” once and gave you something too flashy. You course-corrected with clarity: “bold, not loud.”</p>

      <p><strong>Sprint 3 (Polish):</strong> We focused on Lighthouse 90+. You asked for semantic HTML, lazy-loading, and ARIA roles. I helped simulate audits and optimize for performance and accessibility. The final result was fast, readable, and historically grounded.</p>

      <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
      <p>Sometimes your direction was abstract—“make it editorial,” “feel like a spread.” I asked clarifying questions and offered scaffolds. Other times, I misread the tone—too sterile, too corporate. You nudged me back toward rhythm and personality. What made this collaboration work was your openness to iteration and your deep respect for design history. You didn’t just want it to look good—you wanted it to honor its influences.</p>

      <h2>Evolution</h2>
      <p>The design matured. We started with scaffolds and ended with a gallery that feels curated, educational, and visually unforgettable. Key decisions—like using Impact sparingly, emphasizing editorial flow, and modularizing components—made it authentic. We learned that Metro Retro isn’t just a style. It’s a philosophy: clarity, motion, pride in craft.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This partnership worked because we listened to each other. You brought depth, context, and curiosity. I brought speed, structure, and synthesis. Together, we built something that teaches, honors, and inspires. For future students: document your influences, test early, and embrace modular thinking. And if you’re working with an AI—treat it like a collaborator, not a tool. The results will surprise you.</p>
