      <h2>What Defines the Style</h2>
      <p class="lede">Metro Retro is an intentionally hybrid visual language that pairs Microsoft’s Metro principles (content-first, typographic hierarchy, motion with meaning) with the visual punch and editorial rhythms of 1980s–90s game magazines such as Nintendo Power. The result is a modular, fast UI that reads like a game spread: bold headlines, tight product cards, and clear affordances for customization.</p>

      <p>Technically, it favors grid systems, contrast-rich palettes, and typography-driven navigation. Practically, it reads as a curated storefront: vibrant hero tiles for featured controllers, dense but scannable spec blocks, and animated transitions that emphasize function (filters, add-to-cart, preview).</p>

      <p>Historically, this style traces to mid-century Swiss clarity (grids, objective communication) → transit wayfinding and civic architecture (clear paths, repeatable modules) → Microsoft’s Metro (content-over-chrome, motion, standardized tiles) → editorial gaming aesthetics (dramatic type, callouts, energetic color).</p>

      <h2>Core Principles (practical, prescriptive)</h2>

      <div class="principles">
        <div class="principle">
          <h3>Authentically Digital</h3>
          <p>Design for the screen: rely on layout, contrast, and motion rather than faux-3D textures. Use motion to explain changes (panel expands, tile flips, customization preview shifts), never to distract.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
          <h3>Do More with Less</h3>
          <p>Limit chrome. Prioritize content density where it matters (product specs, price, availability) but keep global chrome minimal (header, filters, cart). Use progressive disclosure for deep specs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
          <h3>Be Fast and Fluid</h3>
          <p>Pretend the interface is a hardware controller: responses must feel instantaneous. Micro-interactions should be under 200ms for hover/press feedback and 200–350ms for meaningful transitions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
          <h3>Typography as UI</h3>
          <p>Headlines and labels are interaction points. Use weight, size, and tracking to prioritize. Impact (for headlines) is permitted as a display face; pair with a neutral UI face for body copy. Kerning and letter-spacing adjustments should be applied to maintain legibility at large sizes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
          <h3>Pride in Craftsmanship</h3>
          <p>Every asset (tile art, product photo, icon) must be optimized and consistent. Establish an assets checklist (sizing, padding, background treatment, shadow rules) so featured tiles always align visually.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
          <h3>Win as One</h3>
          <p>Conform to platform expectations where appropriate (touch targets, focus outlines, keyboard navigation) so the experience feels native across devices while maintaining the brand voice.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>How Visitors Experience It</h2>

      <div class="examples">
        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="accent-heading card-title">Primary experience flows</h3>
          <p><strong>Browse:</strong> Visitors scan a dense grid of product tiles. Large typographic headings sort categories (Controllers, Plates, Sticks, Limited Runs). Filters animate into view; the selected filter becomes a persistent tile in the toolbar.</p>
          <p><strong>Inspect:</strong> Selecting a product opens a focused panel with a large artwork tile, specs block, swatches for color/finish, and a live preview area. Motion anchors state changes—swatch flips the art, plate selection re-renders the mockup.</p>
          <p><strong>Customize:</strong> The customization flow is modal-to-fullscreen on mobile. Each step (button layout, finish, wiring, engraving) uses a combination of large labels and tile-like options; choices push a micro-summary to the right for instant preview.</p>
          <p><strong>Purchase & Return:</strong> Checkout keeps chrome minimal: clear progress steps, a condensed spec snapshot, and confirmation animations that feel celebratory but short.</p>
        </div>

        <aside class="card aside-card" aria-labelledby="examples-heading">
          <h4 id="examples-heading" class="accent-heading">Sensory cues</h4>
          <ul class="sensory-list">
            <li>High-contrast CTAs (dark red on near-black) for primary actions</li>
            <li>Subtle tile elevation via shadow for focus states</li>
            <li>Bold, condensed headlines for hero areas; neutral body for density</li>
            <li>Motion durations keyed to meaning: 200ms feedback, 300–350ms transitions</li>
          </ul>
        </aside>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Practical Implementation Rules</h2>

      <div class="rules">
        <div class="rule">
          <strong>Color</strong>
          <p>Primary palette: dark red (#8b0000), black (#0d0d0d), accent yellow (#ffcc00). Reserve red for primary action and highlight; use accent yellow for callouts and rule lines. Maintain minimum contrast 4.5:1 for body text.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <strong>Typography</strong>
          <p>Display: Impact for H1/H2 (use sparingly). UI / Body: system UI or a neutral sans (Segoe UI, Inter, or Arial fallback). Heading tracking +0.05em, font-kerning: normal, heading weight 400 to avoid overbolding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <strong>Grid & Layout</strong>
          <p>Base grid: 8px system with a 12-column content grid for wide layout. Tile gutters: 20–24px. Product tiles should maintain internal padding of 16px and a 2px accent border to read as discrete units.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <strong>Assets & Photography</strong>
          <p>Controller imagery: neutral background, consistent angle, shadow-less PNGs for overlays. Provide three sizes for tiles (small 160px, medium 320px, hero 720px) with 2:1 and 1:1 crop variants.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <strong>Motion</strong>
          <p>Use motion to communicate: reveal sequences (200–300ms), navigation shifts (300–350ms). Avoid long elaborate animations; provide a reduced-motion alternative via prefers-reduced-motion CSS.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <strong>Accessibility</strong>
          <p>Keyboard focus must be visible and simple; labels for controls; color contrast must meet WCAG AA for body text; preserve readable font sizes (14px+ body, 18px+ for product headings on mobile).</p>
        </div>
      </div>
